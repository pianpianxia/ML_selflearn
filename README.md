## Backgroud

As stated in the title, I create this repository for the purpose of studying materials related to Machine Learning. I would save all the algorithms I learnt in here so that everyone who see this repository can have a basic idea of where I have been so far.

> Example algorithms: kNN, decision Trees, SVM and etc.
